# dataClickTask-linkedinWebScrapping

Objective is to extract connection email and password 

For executing main_script.py, It required 2 input 1st (linkedin username or email) 2nd (password)
Then script extract data into 2 csv 
1st csv contain connection name and profile url
2nd csv contain connection email and phone number


Note: I used if else condition to take input in csv2 line by line, for getting complete data at once just remove last 4 line in main_script.py starting from "command=int(input())
